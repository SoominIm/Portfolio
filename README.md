# Project/Portfolio

## 1. Introduction

This is for projects / porfolios.

## 2. Why?

1. Data Cleaning
- Customer Calls: This seems like a perfect starting point for beginners.
- Nashville Housing: Housing is one of the biggest issues for me and many others, so I found this topic interesting.

2. Data Exploration
- COVID Deaths: When the COVID outbreak started, there were many confirmed cases and deaths. I'm curious about which countries had more deaths and the reasons behind it.
- Lego Analysis: This was my first exploration. While searching online for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) topics, I found this one particularly interesting.

3. Data Prediction
- Telecom Churn: In business, I believe that managing customer churn is more important than acquiring new customers. These days, with the abundance of alternative services, it's easy for customers to use a service for a while and then switch to another. Therefore, retaining current customers is the most critical factor for business success. Additionally, I have used machine learning algorithms to predict future trends.

## 3. Used tools

SQL, Python, Excel
